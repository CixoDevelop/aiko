/*
 * This project is Aiko, an operating system for weak devices like 
 * microcontrollers. It has support for devices based on eight-bit 
 * architectures. It is suitable even for devices with only 128 bytes 
 * of operational memory. You can make it easier to code your projects 
 * based on such platforms by using Aiko as a scheduler.
